## Portfolio Allocation Algorithm

### Age-Based Foundation
```
Base Stock Allocation = max(60%, 120 - age)
```

### Risk Tolerance Multipliers
- **Conservative**: 0.7x
- **Moderate**: 1.0x  
- **Aggressive**: 1.3x

### Goal-Based Adjustments
- **Retirement**: Standard allocation
- **House**: -10% stocks, +5% bonds, +5% cash
- **Education**: -5% stocks, +5% cash
- **Emergency Fund**: -20% stocks, +10% bonds, +10% cash
- **Wealth Building**: +5% stocks, -5% bonds

### Final Allocation Constraints
- Stocks: 30-90%
- Bonds: 5-50%
- Real Estate: 5-20% (higher for income >$100k)
- Cash: 3% minimum

## Expected Returns (Based on Historical Data)

- **Stocks**: 10.0% annual
- **Bonds**: 4.0% annual  
- **Real Estate**: 8.0% annual
- **Cash**: 2.0% annual

## Retirement Planning Methodology

### Replacement Ratio
- Target: 80% of pre-retirement income
- Adjusts for inflation to retirement date

### Nest Egg Calculation
```
Required Nest Egg = (Annual Income Need Ã— 25) / (1 - Tax Rate)
```

### Savings Calculation
Uses future value of annuity formula:
```
Annual Savings = Future Value Ã— Interest Rate / (((1 + Interest Rate)^Years) - 1)
```

    profile: {
      age: 30,

      riskTolerance: 'Moderate',
      investmentGoal: 'Retirement',

  })
});

const plan = await response.json();
console.log('Expected return:', plan.data.portfolioAnalysis.expectedReturn + '%');
```

  body: JSON.stringify({
    profile: userProfile,
    accessToken: plaidAccessToken
  })
});
```

## Best Practices

### For Frontend Integration
1. Cache plans for 1 hour to reduce API calls
2. Update plan when profile changes significantly
3. Show loading states during plan generation
4. Handle offline scenarios gracefully

### For Mobile Apps
1. Compress request payloads
2. Implement request retry logic
3. Use progressive disclosure for complex data
