## 🧮 Financial Methodology

### **Portfolio Allocation Algorithm**
```javascript
// Modern implementation of "100 - age" rule
baseStockAllocation = max(60%, 120 - age)

// Risk tolerance multipliers
Conservative: 0.7x | Moderate: 1.0x | Aggressive: 1.3x

// Goal-based adjustments
Retirement: Standard | House: -10% stocks, +5% bonds, +5% cash
Education: -5% stocks, +5% cash | Emergency: -20% stocks, +10% bonds
```

### **Expected Returns (Historical Analysis)**
- **Stocks**: 10.0% annual
- **Bonds**: 4.0% annual
- **Real Estate**: 8.0% annual  
- **Cash**: 2.0% annual

### **Retirement Planning Formula**
```javascript
// 25x rule with inflation adjustment
requiredNestEgg = (annualIncome × 0.8 × inflationFactor) / withdrawalRate

// Dynamic withdrawal rates
30+ years to retirement: 4.0%
20-30 years: 3.5%
<20 years: 3.0%
```
