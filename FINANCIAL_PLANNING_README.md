## üìä Financial Planning Methodology

### Portfolio Allocation Algorithm

```
1. Age-Based Foundation: Base Stock % = max(60%, 120 - age)
2. Risk Adjustment: Apply multiplier (Conservative: 0.7x, Moderate: 1.0x, Aggressive: 1.3x)
3. Goal-Based Modification: Adjust based on investment objective
4. Constraint Application: Ensure 30-90% stocks, 5-50% bonds, 5-20% real estate, 3%+ cash
```

### Expected Returns (Historical Analysis)
- **Stocks**: 10.0% annually (S&P 500 historical average)
- **Bonds**: 4.0% annually (10-year Treasury + credit spread)
- **Real Estate**: 8.0% annually (REIT total returns)
- **Cash**: 2.0% annually (High-yield savings)

### Retirement Planning Formula

```
Required Nest Egg = (Annual Income Need √ó 25) / (1 - Retirement Tax Rate)

Monthly Savings = Future Value √ó (r / 12) / (((1 + r/12)^(12√óyears)) - 1)
```

Where:
- 25x rule: Based on 4% safe withdrawal rate
- Annual Income Need: 80% of pre-retirement income (inflation-adjusted)
- Retirement Tax Rate: 12% effective rate assumption
